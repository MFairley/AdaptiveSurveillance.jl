Model:
- Think about the most appropriate way to model outbreaks with an SIR model:
    - Change in the beta parameter
    - Add imported cases and switch on beta / change beta
    - the version of this model will determine best how to model the utility function for delay
- Think about how to simulate the expected cost given that events can occur over an infinite horizon
    - Think about for the most basic case with Poisson and step change, simulate expected delay
- See if my problem with repeated cost for false positives can be converted to an optimal stopping problem
    - would enable the theory of optimal stopping to be applied
    - look at Shiryaev paper because it seems to mention a similar thing
